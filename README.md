# WebScraper
Webscraper
This project will scan the National Geographic "New Stories" and append it to a new page.
The scraping will include the story, flavor text for the story, and then a URL to visit.
By clicking on the story, you can then make a note about the project and visit it. 

This relies on Mongoose and MongoDB to store the data in an object based format.
